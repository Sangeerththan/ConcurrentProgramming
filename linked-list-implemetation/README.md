# Linked List Implementation : Serial & Parallel (Mutex, Read Write Locks)

This repository contains linked list implementation as follows; 
  - Serial program
  - Parallel program (based on Pthreads) with one mutex for the entire linked list
  - Parallel program (based on Pthreads) with read-write locks for the entire linked list

The implementation of the linked list supports Member( ), Insert( ), and Delete( ) functions of the linked list. The performance comparison of each implemtation can be found on https://nishadikirielle.wordpress.com/2016/08/14/linked-list-implementation-serial-parallel-mutex-read-write-locks/
